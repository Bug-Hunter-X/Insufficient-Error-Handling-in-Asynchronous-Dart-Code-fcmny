# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: inadequate error handling for API calls and other network requests. The `bug.dart` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version.

The primary issue is the lack of comprehensive error checking in the response from the API.  The original code only handles exceptions during the network request itself. It doesn't account for API errors that return a non-200 status code, leading to potential crashes or unexpected data processing.

The solution involves additional checks of `response.statusCode` to handle non-successful API responses. The solution will also include robust logging to aid in debugging.
